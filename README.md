# Nila-AI Therapist

**Nila-AI** is an advanced conversational AI chatbot designed to provide compassionate and insightful guidance on personal relationships and life challenges. Built using Googleâ€™s Generative AI API for natural language understanding and **pyttsx3** for faster, offline Text-to-Speech (TTS) responses, it serves as a virtual therapist for users seeking emotional support.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Nila-AI leverages Google Generative AI to respond intelligently and contextually.
- **Offline Text-to-Speech**: Integrated with `pyttsx3` for real-time, offline voice responses with minimal delay.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for smooth deployment and interaction.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: Contains the core logic with updated Text-to-Speech functionality using `pyttsx3`.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required dependencies.
- **legacy/**: Contains the original Jupyter Notebook (`Nila_AI_Therapist.ipynb`) for historical reference.

## How It Works

The chatbot interacts via the terminal, responding to user inputs with text and audio. It uses Google Generative AI for generating meaningful replies, while `pyttsx3` provides offline, faster TTS with minimal delay compared to online TTS services.

### Core Workflow:
1. **Input**: User queries.
2. **Processing**: Google Generative AI analyzes the query and generates a response.
3. **Output**: The response is either returned as text or spoken aloud using `pyttsx3`.
